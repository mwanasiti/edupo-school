## Project Description
Problem Statement:
Managing routine working-on manually has always been a daunting task for the management team. Due to an apparent lack of technology, administrators and other stakeholders have a difficult time achieving their designated goals in allotted time. As a result, the institute begins to lag behind other institutes, causing them to lose the desired candidate’s attention. 

Solution statement:
Success in everyday tasks is what’s in demand of the emerging education system, and to achieve that you need a robust and comprehensive school management system which will automate your institution’s operations. It improves the efficiency and effectiveness of daily institutional operations.
